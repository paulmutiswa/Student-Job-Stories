<h1>Student Job Stories</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
I created a detailed project using Power BI to depict the stories and experiences of students at BYU-Idaho, Ensign College, and BYU-Pathway. Through extensive research and collaboration with various departments and institutions, I collected a vast array of data points encompassing academic performance, extracurricular engagement, graduation rates, internships, average living wage, work rate per hour, number of students in need of jobs, employment opportunities, and overall student satisfaction. With this information in hand, I meticulously constructed visually appealing dashboards utilizing Power BI's interactive features to showcase key findings and trends. The project aimed to provide administrators and stakeholders with comprehensive insights into the educational journey of students across these three institutions. By presenting data-driven narratives and actionable recommendations derived from Power BI's advanced analytical capabilities, my work contributed to informed decision-making processes that further enhanced the quality of education provided by these prestigious universities.
